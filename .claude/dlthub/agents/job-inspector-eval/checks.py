"""Deterministic layer of the job-inspector-eval agent.

One function per check, registered in `CHECKS` by id. A check reads an `EvalContext` and
returns a `CheckResult`. Judge checks register with no function, so the registry is the one
list of check ids.

`prepare` resolves the inspector run, fetches everything, runs the deterministic checks and
builds the evidence the judge reads. `finalize` writes the computed results over the judge's
output. A check docstring opens with the instruction it grades, which is the sentence the
summary reports, and then states TRUE, FALSE and N/A. `BACKGROUND_AGENTS.md` covers
deployment.
