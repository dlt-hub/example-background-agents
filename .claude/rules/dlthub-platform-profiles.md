# Profiles
1. Locally pipelines and datasets run on `dev` profile.
2. On runtime pipelines (batch jobs) run on `prod` profile
3. On runtime notebooks (interactive jobs) run on `access` profile. if not defined they run on `prod` profile.
4. Agent jobs (`run.agent(...)`) **NEVER** run on `prod`. They are batch jobs, so they get `prod` unless told otherwise: always pin `require={"profile": "access"}` so production secrets are not injected.
   The pin covers profile-scoped secrets only — a variable set with `--workspace` reaches every profile, so scope one an agent must not see with `--profile`. Work needing production write credentials goes in a pipeline or a plain job, not an agent.
5. If user pins a different profile - it is used to run pipelines and datasets locally.
6. Get workspace info (via cli or mcp tool) to see a list of profiles. **configured** profiles are one

# Secrets and configs
1. Profiles have corresponding secrets and configs.
2. `config.toml` and `secrets.toml` apply to **all profiles**. Keep only common settings in them
3. `dev.config.toml` and `dev.secrets.toml` define settings specific to `dev` profile
4. Settings in profile-scoped toml files overwrite workspace-scoped toml files.
5. Use `dlthub ai secrets` as usual — `update-fragment` requires `--path`, so always pass the right file! `dlthub ai secrets list` when in doubt.

# Switch profile
* set `WORKSPACE__PROFILE` env variable when running Python commands to temporarily switch profile
* pin profile with `dlthub local profile use <name>` to change profile in this session. **require to switch mcp server**
